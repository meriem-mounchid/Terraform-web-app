### Virtual Private Clouds ###
+ lets you have a virtual network 
    => so that you can select your own IP address range
    => create your own subnets
    => configure your route tables & network gateways
+ Create a new VPC
    - The VPC
    - One of the subnets
    - An Internet gateway
### Subnets ###
+ Subnets
    - is a range of IP addresses in your VPC
        > to help minimize traffic
+ Route table:
    - A set of rules known as routes that determine where network traffic is directed
+ A public subnet
    - is linked to a routing table and has a route to an Internet gateway
    - this links the VPC to the Internet as well as other AWS services.
        > can send outbound traffic directly to the Internet and vice versa
        > Users from the internet must be able to access a web server.
+ A private subnet
    - is associated with a routing table but does not have a route to an internet gateway (NAT)
        > DB
        > Back-End

### Security Groups ###
+ Security Groups:
    - acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances
    > control incoming and outgoing traffic

### Elastic Compute Cloud ###
+ EC2:
    - allows you to run servers in the cloud
    - to create and run virtual machines in the cloud
### Simple Storage Service ###
+ S3:
    - for storing large amounts of static data and ideal for data backups
### Identity and Access Management ###
+ IAM:
    - is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources
    > IAM is used to manage AWS users and their access to AWS resources
+ MFA:
    - Multi-Factor Authentication
    > adds extra security to the account
    - IAM is a global service it is not restricted to one region
+ Roles:
    - is a database object that groups together one or more privileges and can be assigned to users
### Load Balancer ###
+ is a service that automatically distributes incoming web traffic across multiple EC2
    - Application Load Balancer (ALB)
        > is best suited for routing HTTP/HTTPS traffic
    - Network Load Balancer (NLB)
        > is best suited for TCP/UDP traffic.
### Security Group ###
+ Egress: refers to outgoing network traffic from a resource
+ Ingress: refers to incoming network traffic to a resource

### RDS Databases ###
+ It makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.
+ With RDS, you can provision a database instance, configure network access, and choose the amount of storage and memory that you need.
+ RDS automatically manages tasks such as backups, patching, and failure detection, so you can focus on developing and deploying your applications.
